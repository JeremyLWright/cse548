SleekXMPP

SleekXMPP is an MIT licensed XMPP library for Python 2.6/3.1+, and is featured in examples in XMPP: The Definitive Guide by Kevin Smith, Remko Tronçon, and Peter Saint-Andre. If you've arrived here from reading the Definitive Guide, please see the notes on updating the examples to the latest version of SleekXMPP.

SleekXMPP's design goals and philosphy are:

Low number of dependencies

    Installing and using SleekXMPP should be as simple as possible, without having to deal with long dependency chains.

    As part of reducing the number of dependencies, some third party modules are included with SleekXMPP in the thirdparty directory. Imports from this module first try to import an existing installed version before loading the packaged version, when possible.
Every XEP as a plugin
    Following Python's "batteries included" approach, the goal is to provide support for all currently active XEPs (final and draft). Since adding XEP support is done through easy to create plugins, the hope is to also provide a solid base for implementing and creating experimental XEPs.
Rewarding to work with
    As much as possible, SleekXMPP should allow things to "just work" using sensible defaults and appropriate abstractions. XML can be ugly to work with, but it doesn't have to be that way.

Get the Code

Get the latest stable version from PyPI:

 pip install sleekxmpp

The latest source code for SleekXMPP may be found on Github . Releases can be found in the master branch, while the latest development version is in the develop branch.

Latest Release

        1.1.11

Develop Releases

        Latest Develop Version

Installing DNSPython

If you are using Python3 and wish to use dnspython, you will have to checkout and install the python3 branch:

 git clone http://github.com/rthalley/dnspython
cd dnspython
git checkout python3
python3 setup.py install

Discussion

A mailing list and XMPP chat room are available for discussing and getting help with SleekXMPP.

Mailing List
    SleekXMPP Discussion on Google Groups 
Chat
    sleek@conference.jabber.org 

Documentation and Testing

Documentation can be found both inline in the code, and as a Sphinx project in /docs . To generate the Sphinx documentation, follow the commands below. The HTML output will be in docs/_build/html :

 cd docs
make html
open _build/html/index.html

To run the test suite for SleekXMPP:

 python testall.py

The SleekXMPP Boilerplate

Projects using SleekXMPP tend to follow a basic pattern for setting up client/component connections and configuration. Here is the gist of the boilerplate needed for a SleekXMPP based project. See the documetation or examples directory for more detailed archetypes for SleekXMPP projects:

 import logging

from sleekxmpp import ClientXMPP
from sleekxmpp.exceptions import IqError, IqTimeout


class EchoBot(ClientXMPP):

    def __init__(self, jid, password):
        ClientXMPP.__init__(self, jid, password)

        self.add_event_handler("session_start", self.session_start)
        self.add_event_handler("message", self.message)

        # If you wanted more functionality, here's how to register plugins:
        # self.register_plugin('xep_0030') # Service Discovery
        # self.register_plugin('xep_0199') # XMPP Ping

        # Here's how to access plugins once you've registered them:
        # self['xep_0030'].add_feature('echo_demo')

        # If you are working with an OpenFire server, you will
        # need to use a different SSL version:
        # import ssl
        # self.ssl_version = ssl.PROTOCOL_SSLv3

    def session_start(self, event):
        self.send_presence()
        self.get_roster()

        # Most get_*/set_* methods from plugins use Iq stanzas, which
        # can generate IqError and IqTimeout exceptions
        #
        # try:
        #     self.get_roster()
        # except IqError as err:
        #     logging.error('There was an error getting the roster')
        #     logging.error(err.iq['error']['condition'])
        #     self.disconnect()
        # except IqTimeout:
        #     logging.error('Server is taking too long to respond')
        #     self.disconnect()

    def message(self, msg):
        if msg['type'] in ('chat', 'normal'):
            msg.reply("Thanks for sending\n%(body)s" % msg).send()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Ideally use optparse or argparse to get JID,
    # password, and log level.

    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG,
                        format='%(levelname)-8s %(message)s')

    xmpp = EchoBot('somejid@example.com', 'use_getpass')
    xmpp.connect()
    xmpp.process(block=True)
