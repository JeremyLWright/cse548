      <div id="content">
        <p>Strophe is a collection of libraries for speaking the <a href="http://xmpp.org/">XMPP</a> protocol. While most XMPP libraries and implementations are focused on chat-based applications, Strophe takes a grander view. It has been used to implement real-time games, notification systems, search engines, as well as traditional instant messaging.</p>

<p>The implementations are production ready, well documented, easy to use, and easy to extend.</p>

<h1 id="the_strophe_family">The Strophe Family</h1>

<p>There are currently two members of the Strophe family of libraries.</p>

<h2 id="strophejs">Strophe.js</h2>

<p><a href="http://strophe.im/strophejs">Strophe.js</a> is a JavaScript implementation targeting browser-based clients. It uses <a href="http://xmpp.org/about-xmpp/technology-overview/bosh/">BOSH</a>, a binding of XMPP to HTTP using long polling and WebSockets, a full-duplex single socket connection to a server. Strophe.js makes creating real-time web applications easy.</p>

<h2 id="libstrophe">libstrophe</h2>

<p><a href="http://strophe.im/libstrophe">libstrophe</a> is a C library for XMPP clients and components. It has very minimal dependencies and was designed with both POSIX and Windows systems in mind.</p>
