In this paper the authors present a high performance peer-to-peer Ethernet {POWERLINK} implementation. Instead of using a Managing Node it builds on the concept of a bus master whose sole purpose is to schedule traffic on the bus enabling the nodes to communicate with each other using the cross-traffic facility. The authors present the solution architecture, discuss implementation aspects and propose a change to the {POWERLINK} standard based on drawn conclusions.},

The {TTP/A} specification describes a pure communication system and leaves a lot of decisions regarding physical layer, fault detection, redundancy, etc. to the system designer.

Many kinds of fieldbus protocols work on {IP}, but they are designed on {IPv4.} {IPv6} can provide some advanced features, which is useful for fieldbus. Therefore, it is useful to consider the adaptation of each fieldbus to {IPv6} and the co-existence of {IPv6} and {IPv4} based fieldbus. This paper explains the experiments used to provide interoperability among {IPv6} based field devices and among {IPv6} based and {IPv4} based field devices. The authors concluded that the {IPv6} adaptation design deeply depends on the co-existence scenario. Additionally, a simple principle of binding fieldbus protocol stack instance to only one of {IPv4} or {IPv6} makes the solution easier. The authors choose {FOUNDATION} Fieldbus {HSE} for this work since it is the representative of {IP} Based fieldbus protocols.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the design of a network master device for the multifunction vehicle bus. An analysis of the specifications for this bus administrator reveals that the functional design can be arranged in 14 operational blocks and in a special memory for communication data known as the traffic store. System-on-a-chip strategies have been adopted in order to cope with this great complexity. The architecture includes a standard on-chip bus, which is aimed at interconnecting all the modules as cores attached to it by an established interface. In this way, creation flow can be concurrent, and design for reuse is made easier. The entire architecture has been coded in {SystemC} not only for verification purposes but also for setting the intermediate point in the refinement process toward the register transfer-level design. After validating this executable description by simulation, the hardware/software partition has been performed following the codesign philosophy. Estimations about consumed silicon area, hardware response time, occupied program memory, and software execution time have been made in order to calculate a cost function for each functional block: the cost-performance difference. From these, an optimum hardware/software architecture has been obtained. As a result, the electronic platform for the master device has been generated on a field-programmable gate array. The final implementation contains a soft processor as the main component, a {ROM}, a {RAM}, some internal registers, and the Traffic Store.},

In our analysis of circuit protection we consider the problem of battery discharge and how to avoid the dump load. To control these functions of the electrical architecture, a data communications bus must be provided. In this paper we analyze 4 buses ({CAN}, {TTP}, {LIN} and {RDbus)} that comply with the appropriate requirements for this type of control. This new electrical system should perform at least the same as the previous one as far as security, reliability and robustness are concerned. Finally, we discuss the most appropriate electrical and communication architectures according to present day requirements.},

	abstract = {Bus lanes were one of the main means of giving priority to buses, increasing their reliability, and making buses more attractive because the bus might travel to its destination faster than a car. But bus lanes have to be enforced. The police can enforce bus lanes, but it is an inevitable consequence of a police officer stopping a vehicle driving in a bus lane that often causes the congestion itself. The sheer practicality of waving down a vehicle in a bus lane and taking enforcement action delays buses still further. An alternative had to be found. The camera seemed to be the solution. Transport for London's vision for the future is the complete and continuous enforcement of all traffic regulations on its network and, in partnership with the boroughs, on their network. Its vision is for a digital basis for this enforcement and effectively for virtual real time enforcement by using the airwaves for the transmission of data.},

It is very important research direction for accurately detecting {CT} saturation in bus-bar differential protection. Analyzing {CT} saturation detection methods of the current waveform, the variety of differential current, harmonic ratio, and so on, these methods are not best solutions for serious {CT} saturation.

	abstract = {Ethernet-based in-car communication is currently a hot topic in the automotive industry. Soon Ethernet will start to oust {MOST} bus in its domain of info- and entertainment applications. However, the full benefit of a technologically integrated in-car network will only become rewarding with the deployment of an Ethernet-based backbone that integrates all automotive domains on a single layer at increased bandwidth, reduced complexity and cost, while opening car intelligence for future innovations. Such backbone must transport critical control data in real-time. Standard Ethernet requires extensions to comply with the strict timing requirements of driver assistance and safety applications while simultaneously supporting broadband multimedia traffic. In this paper, we compare {IEEE} 802.1 {AVB} and Time-triggered Ethernet, two competing real-time approaches. While the first fosters over- provisioning and prioritisation, the second is based on a coordinated time-division-multiple-access ({TDMA)} policy for media access. By simulating a realistic in-car backbone design and traffic model, we reveal the strengths and weaknesses of both protocols and point to the diverging characteristics of event- and time-triggered policies. Our results show that in this in-car network scenario both protocols are able to meet the rigid timing requirements, while each has its unique benefits and disadvantages.},

	abstract = {Bus Stops for school busses incorporate a special risk to school children. Most accidents on the way to school occur at or close to the school bus stops. Modern {ITS} telecommunication technology can be applied to make bus stops safer and inform car drivers about dangerous bus stops on their route. In order to raise the acceptance of speed limits at bus stops it can help to reliably inform the drivers if there are actually children close to the bus stop. When no children are using the bus stop the traffic can circulate without special precautions. Modern {ITST} technology can be used to detect the presence of school children. In a European funded project within {FP7} framework the Amparo Solutions tag-based technology is used to detect nearby children who carry a radio transmitter. A bus stop unit receives this information and can activate special warnings to the surrounding traffic. In the current paper an empirical experimental study is described where 3 warning conditions have been compared in a driving simulator: a school bus stop sign, a school bus stop sign with flashing lights on top of it and a school bus stop sign in combination with an in-vehicle information design. The experimental design allows comparison of driver behavior at bus stops with and without children under the three different warning conditions. Dependent variables are: speed, lateral distance, reaction time to a child jumping on the street and the number of collisions. Overall 60 drivers participate to the driving simulator study. This number allows statistical evidence on the safety effects of different bus stop warnings. Results show that the two warning strategies are highly effective in terms of speed reduction in comparison to not providing any special warning about the children. The comparison of the two warning strategies (road sign with lightning and in-vehicle information) show no significant differences in driver behavior and very small effect sizes. In conclusion either system can be ap- - plied to reduce the speed when passing by bus stops with children, the number of collisions however could not be reduced significantly in this study.},

The proposed system solely relies on the collaborative effort of the participating users and is independent from the bus operating companies, so it can be easily adopted to support universal bus service systems without requesting support from particular bus operating companies. Instead of referring to {GPS} enabled location information, we resort to more generally available and energy efficient sensing resources, including cell tower signals, movement statuses, audio recordings, etc., which bring less burden to the participatory party and encourage their participation. We develop a prototype system with different types of Android based mobile phones and comprehensively experiment with the {NTU} campus shuttle buses, Singapore public buses as well as London bus system over a 7-week period. The evaluation results suggest that the proposed system achieves outstanding prediction accuracy compared with those bus operator initiated and {GPS} supported solutions.},

As a result, power consumption and critical path delay are both reduced. Experimental results obtained by simulating a delay model and a power model demonstrate that the proposed segmented bus system reduces bus power by about 60\%-70\% and improves critical bus delay by about 10\%-30\%.},

	doi = {10.1109/VDAT.2005.1500015},
	abstract = {Reducing power consumption of embedded system has gained much attention recently. Reducing memory bus switchings is an effective way to reduce system power since memory bus power constitutes a great portion of the system power. While many techniques exist for reducing bus power in address buses, only a few have been proposed for content-bus power reduction. We propose a bus-invert and bus-invert with transition signaling ({BIBITS)} encoding scheme to reduce power consumption on instruction bus. An instruction is partitioned into fields according to its format. Four elementary Boolean functions are used as encoding functions. {BIBITS} uses the most suitable encoding functions for different instruction partitions. We also propose a register relabeling algorithm for {BIBITS} encoding to further reduce bit switchings on register fields. Simulation results show that the overall average switching reduction is 64\% of unencoded bus, 59\% of the previous register relabeling scheme, and 33\% of Petrov's bus encoding scheme. Compared with Petrov's bus encoding scheme, our scheme uses a decoding signal table only half the size to encode all basic blocks.},

	doi = {10.1109/VLSID.2007.126},
	abstract = {Dynamic bus power dissipation, especially for long global signal buses, is becoming increasingly important with technology scaling due to several reasons: more pronounced interwire coupling effects, higher frequencies, greater traffic demands arising from higher levels of integration (e.g., as seen in system-on-chip and multi-core designs), and power density concerns, among others. While low-power dynamic bus encoding schemes, such as bus invert ({BI)} and odd-even bus invert ({OEBI)}, have been proposed to reduce bus switching activities, they are not effective for wide microprocessor buses carrying correlated traffic found in typical workloads like {SPEC} {CPU2000} benchmarks. To address this, we propose a partitioned hybrid bus encoding technique in which the bus is partitioned optimally and the most energy-efficient dynamic encoding scheme- we consider bus invert ({BI)}, odd/even bus invert ({OEBI)}, and not encoding as the possible options, but any other collection of schemes can be considered-is independently applied to each partition depending upon traffic value characteristics to minimize total bus (wire self and interwire coupling) dynamic energy. While {BI} and {OEBI} provide average energy reductions of only 5.27\%/1.58\% and 0.98\%/1.97\% for data/instruction buses, respectively, for {SPEC} {CPU2k} benchmarks, our hybrid encoding technique yields average energy savings of 22.07\%/27.40\% for the same traffic and buses-these results take into account the energy consumed by control lines, too},

By the new bus stop board, passengers could obtain not only the information of the bus line and information of lines in one station, but also important bus-stations, passenger transport hubs, geographical position information and so on.

However, the customer suffers the system instability issue caused by impedance overlap between the bus converter and {POL.} Bus converter has three types i) un-regulated, ii) semi-regulated, iii) full-regulated, and each type has different output characteristic. This makes matter more complex to understand and difficult to resolve the instability phenomena. This paper investigates the comparison of the stability of three types of bus converter and {POL} using steady state average model. As a result, it has been found that "un-regulated bus {converter+POL"} is the most stable, "full-regulated bus {converter+POL"} is next due to dumping of the resonant peak of impedance by the loop feedback, "semi-regulated bus {converter+POL"} is the most un-stable, therefore a large capacitor at the intermediate bus is needed},

Here, we take up generation of timetables. In general, timetable generation is considered as a very simple problem. However, there are some difficult problems. Firstly, bus stops of the same name are managed as one bus stop in the database of our system on grounds that error and cost decrease. Therefore, when timetables are generated, such bus stops must be distinguished. Secondly, there are so many bus stops in the timetables of bus route. However, all of them are not needed for an individual user in most cases. Thus, some bus stops may be excluded when a user intends to obtain a timetable of a bus route.

Most importantly. this system integrates bus and mass rapid transit information together in contrast to the existing {SMS} service on bus guide by {SingTel}, a leading telecom company in Singapore where it only provides bus information. The system also provides bus arrival information that allows a subscriber to acquire the arrival times of bus services at a bus stop. In addition, a subscriber is able to flag a bus through {SMS} while on the way to the bus stop and while a subscriber is reaching a particular bus stop, he/she will be alerted through {SMS} by the system.

	abstract = {High-speed message communications is addressed. Each node in the system consists of multiple processors interconnected by a broadcast bus, but the individual nodes are interconnected by an arbitrary network. The concept of a poll number is proposed to control the access to an intranode bus, minimizing the probability of real-time messages missing their deadlines. When a task generates a time-constrained message, a poll number associated with the message is computed on the basis of the message deadline and the task priority. When the bus is free, the various tasks at a node which desire to use the bus write the poll number onto the bus and read it back, one bit at a time, starting from the most significant bit. If at any time the bit read back is different from the bit written, then that particular task drops out of the competition for the bus. The mechanism provides for not only decentralized control of the intranode bus, but also a high degree of flexibility in scheduling messages by different ways of generating poll numbers. The probability of a message missing its deadline in a token bus is found to be much higher than in a polled bus},

	abstract = {High impedance bus differential relays are used on most of the busses in North America. The popularity can be explained by the good performance of this scheme in relation to {CT} saturation and the low cost, if used on a simple bus system. However with the introduction of numerical relays and their low {CT} burden as well as their ability of measuring several feeder currents, a low impedance bus differential principal could be applied on simple busses also. In addition, the availability of fiber optic communication inside of the substation allows the use of decentralized bus system in which the {CT} output values becomes transmitted via communication to a centralized unit versus having {CT} wires running to the control house. Low impedance bus differential protection systems have many positive attributes. Common advantages of all low impedance bus protection schemes are the ability to be able to use {CT's} of different ratios on respective branch inputs and the fact that the same {CT} used for the bus protection can be shared with the feeder protection relay. The question needs to be discussed what selection criteria needs to get evaluated for the selection of the appropriate principal. The paper will give an overview on both principles and explain the difference in building and evaluating of the differential current. The effect of {CT} saturation during external and internal faults will be discussed in details for both schemes as well as the {CT} requirements. Some advanced numerical techniques employed in low impedance bus differential relays to recognize {CT} saturation on heavy through-faults and avoid false tripping are presented. Common guidelines for setting both principles will be reviewed and explained in detail and some examples will be shown. The influence of the complexity of the bus system on the selection will be discussed. Benefits and disadvantages of both systems will be compared. The comparison will also include the difference during the installation, commissioning- , operation and maintenance phase of the different systems. The evaluation will be done technically as well as economically.},

Measuring the shift of the center frequency of {SAW} sensors can be used to obtain the applied torque of the rotation axis. The measuring system mainly uses the {RSSI} signal with respect to the frequency to find the {SAW} center frequency value, and then the value of frequency shift can be transferred to the torque values. Besides, to achieve the wireless transmission, a coupling-type antenna is applied on the axis. Finally, the torque signal is passed through {CANBUS} to integrate with the other vehicles electron systems.},

The microwave beamforming networks are intended for automotive communications beam scanning electronically steered arrays. Although the frequency range likely to be allocated to such systems is 63 {GHz}, where the short transmission range allows multiple frequency re-use, the planar beamforming networks are frequency scaled models to verify the concept. The objective of this investigation is to develop microwave beamforming networks suitable for a use in inter-vehicle ({IVC)} and roadside-to-vehicle ({RVC)} automotive communications electronically steered arrays. The steerable microwave beamforming networks demonstrate appropriateness to develop well-established designs for systems that can be used in automotive communications beam scanning electronically steered array and vehicular telematics.},

	abstract = {An optical wireless communication ({OWC)} system based on a light-emitting-diode ({LED)} transmitter and a camera receiver has been developed for use in the automotive area. The automotive {OWC} system will require Mb/s-class data rates and the ability to quickly detect {LEDs} from an image. The key to achieving this is improvements to the capabilities of the image sensor mounted on the camera receiver. In this paper, we report on a novel {OWC} system equipped with an optical communication image sensor ({OCI)}, which is newly developed using {CMOS} technology. To obtain higher transmission rates, the {OCI} employs a specialized “communication pixel ({CPx)”} capable of responding promptly to optical intensity variations. Furthermore, a new quick {LED} detection technique, based on a 1-bit flag image which only reacts to high-intensity objects, is formulated. The communication pixels, ordinary image pixels, and associated circuits (including 1-bit flag image output circuits) are then integrated into the {OCI.} This paper describes the design, fabrication, and capabilities of the {OCI}, as well as the development of the {LED} and image sensor based {OWC} system, which boasts a 20-Mb/s/pixel data rate without {LED} detection and a 15-Mb/s/pixel data rate with a 16.6-ms real-time {LED} detection.},

	doi = {10.1109/ECRTS.2005.7},
	abstract = {The number of embedded computers used in modern cars have increased dramatically during the last years, as they provide increased functionality to a reduced cost compared to previous technologies. These computers are often connected by one or more communication networks and the data traffic sent over the networks often has hard real-time requirements. To provide overall system timing guarantees, upper timing bounds need to be derived both for the data traffic and the embedded computer programs that controls the communication. In this article, we present a case study where static worst-case execution time ({WCET)} analysis was used to find upper time bounds for time-critical code in products from Volcano Communications Technologies {AB} ({VCT).} The {VCT} company provides tools for development of real-time communication solutions for embedded network systems, mainly used within the car industry. {VCT's} tool suite includes support for Controller Area Network ({CAN)}, Local Interconnect Network ({LIN)}, {FlexRay} and {MOST} network traffic. The primary purpose of the study was not to test the accuracy of the obtained {WCET} estimates, but rather to investigate the practical difficulties that arise when applying current {WCET} analysis methods to these particular kind of systems. A central question was if today is static {WCET} analysis tools can be used in the automotive software development process. In particular, we were interested in how labor-intensive the analysis becomes, measured by the number of manual annotations necessary to perform the analysis. As a result, we provide some qualitative observations on desirable research results for making static {WCET} analysis applicable in typical automotive software development.},

This system-level test goes far beyond the (isolated) test of single components and represents a substantial problem, that seems to be still largely unsolved, although its solution is crucial for maintaining the consumers' trust in modern automotive electronics. In this paper we concentrate on the test of distributed systems based on {FlexRay}, the protocol that is envisioned as the communication backbone for future automotive systems. The cornerstones of our approach are a decomposition of the system into layers and mechanisms, and a versatile strategy for monitoring and stimulation under various conditions. Our concept can be adapted to diverse needs ranging from an early debugging with full access to the system, over non-intrusive online testing during interoperability tests, to maintenance testing that is restricted to a remote access only. We give detailed discussions of the requirements and present our solutions for the various issues involved. Selected use cases demonstrate the usefulness of the taken approach.},

Those services require a reliable high data rate connection which could be provided by cellular {LTE} which supports channel adaptive {MIMO} transmission. However, at the automotive side, confined space is available to accommodate the antennas which gives rise to spatial correlation and mobility introduces uncertainty about the wireless channel which governs a future transmission and hence limits the adaptation accuracy. Both effects carry a high potential to decrease the data rate. This work presents field trial results for spatial correlation and assesses the impact of both effects. The results indicate that the performance loss due to mobility can significantly exceed the loss due to spatial correlation.},

	abstract = {The nature of wireless communication protocols used in automotive industry (eg. {TPMS} - Tire Pressure Monitoring System, {RKE} Remote Key-less Entry or {PEPS-} Passive Entry \& Passive Start) and fact, that transmission between remote sensor and main controller has to be received and correctly decoded, require sophisticated receiver systems. Complexity of systems installed in modern vehicles and variety of multiple conditions cause that verification and validation is the most difficult step of whole design process. Especially important part, that must be carefully checked, is behavior of a system in case of incorrect transmission. These false conditions should be repetitive, exact and comprehensive. Usage of Software Defined Radio ({SDR)} technique makes posible to fulfill all mentioned above requirements. This article describes utilization of {SDR} modeling with {GNURadio} to achieve flexible and very powerful Verification Platform for one-way automotive communication protocols. Description is focused on {TPMS} module however our solution works well for other protocols such as {PEPS}, {RKE} and similar.},

	abstract = {Time-triggered architectures are being introduced in safety-critical automotive systems ({"X-by-wire")} to cope with the growing complexity and the high safety demands. One of their merits is to provide a static operation schedule, thus largely reducing the complexity of (otherwise input-dependent) execution flow. This, however, comes for the price of increased configuration complexity: the {FlexRay} protocol that implements the time-triggered paradigm on the communication level requires several tens of configuration parameters. The product of their possible settings spans a space of more than {10M48} (theoretical) configurations. This does not represent a problem as long as the configuration is known and fault-free. However, in many cases - ranging from debugging over conformance testing to maintenance - an identification of the configuration is desirable, but turns out extremely burdensome. This paper presents a systematic approach that facilitates parameter identification in such complex systems. Experimental results illustrate the usefulness of our approach and explore its limitations.},

Ongoing activities such as Autosar, {FlexRay}, {HIS} (Herstellerinitiative Software - {OEM} initiative software) and more, underline the car industry's contribution to create and establish these standards. Another way - more linked to {OEM's} internal processes - is to undertake a deeper analysis of architecture work. Here at first, a profound description is essential. This tool-based description is the basis for a more detailed analysis. Two options should be focussed upon: expert reviews and automatically calculated metrics in the tool, such as cost, weight or even more sophisticated metrics for feasability. With this technique, iteration by iteration the {EE} architecture reaches more profound stability and meets the functional and non-functional requirements far better},

The main focus of the article lies on on the analytic description of the mode-conversion induced by automotive inline-connectors (including the untwisted lines before and after the in-line-connector), as compared to the mode-conversion of typcial common-mode chokes used for the considered differential bus systems. Analytical results thereby are compared in detail to results obtained by numerical modelling as well as to measurement results for a 100 {MBit/s} automotive Ethernet-system. It is shown, that the emission within the frequency band of the information signal strongly depends on the level of mode conversion. For automotive high speed bus systems like the 100 {MBit/s} Ethernet system investigated in this article, this leads to a significant emission in case of state-of-the-art common-mode chokes and in-line-connectors used nowadays. It is shown, that the analytical description and modelling of (assembled) in-line-connectors covers all of the key parameters in order to reliably predict mode-conversion and therefore radiated emission.},

	doi = {10.1109/RAST.2005.1512606},
	abstract = {Low Earth orbits ({LEO)} typically ranges from an altitude of 100 kms to 1000 kms above the surface of Earth. {LEO} has a typical inclination angle ranging from 95 to 105. Satellite Mission objectives, in these orbits, are mainly Earth observation and remote sensing. In general, such missions provide greater details of the planet Earth to its inhabitants for monitoring and managing their resources effectively. In particular, the engineering of these missions poses more challenges to its designers \& developers. Remote sensing satellites enhance the complexity of spacecraft architecture because of the constraints of sophisticated Payload \& subsidiary electronics and telemetry data acquisition in a limited time slot during satellite passes over ground segment, which requires lots of buffering. Spacecraft communication Bus is an integral part of satellite, used for low. level word-oriented data acquisition \& control as well as higher-level packet transfers amongst different modules of satellite subsystems. This paper describes the utilization of controller area network ({CAN)} as a Spacecraft communication Bus and discusses different design aspects of {CANbus} network for Pakistan's Remote Sensing Satellite. Presented is the design of {CANbus} Network for Telemetry \& telecommand for On-Board Data handling. The system is a Multi-master distributed Network that follows the broadcast communication mechanism. That is, the information is being transmitted to all nodes in the network. Every Node receives the same data at same time \& filters out unwanted messages. A brief introduction of {CAN} protocol's flexibility and working mechanism is provided in the beginning of this paper. Next is the Experimental setup arranged in which this protocol is being implemented to verify bus design aspects and results are discussed. In the end, we conclude with our observation about {CAN's} behavior as a spacecraft communication bus.},

Upcoming car series will be deployed with flexible time-triggered communication protocols due to benefits with respect to bandwidth, predictability, dependability and flexible system integration. In order to support the reuse of existing {CAN-based} applications, flexible time-triggered {CAN} ({FTTCAN)} has been released to support more dependable and flexible scheduling real-time both periodic and sporadic messages by planning-based services.

For the latter alternative, we want to show a methodology in this paper, how to obtain meaningful communication data samples and how to analyze this data thoroughly in order to derive the important measurement of durations of controller startup phases. We use commonly applied data logging and evaluation tools from {CONDALOtrade} and Vectortrade and we present results for networked applications in current upper class series vehicles from the German car manufacturer Audi. The outcomes allow for a sophisticated analysis of {CAN} communication at an early stage of prototype hardware installations.},

The default trial asymmetric {PKI/ECDSA} security mechanism is known for its high computational cost, thus lacking applicability in life-critical safety messaging. Alternative security schemes, such as symmetric methods provide faster communication at the expense of reduced security. Hence, hybrid and hardware based solutions were proposed by researchers to ease the issue. However, these solutions either do not support the existing {VANET} {PKI} standard or have larger message size. In this paper, we present a hardware based security framework that uses both standard asymmetric {PKI} and symmetric cryptography for faster and secure safety message exchange. The proposed framework is expected to improve security mechanism in {VANET} by developing trust relationship among the neighboring nodes, hence forming trusted groups. The trust is established via Trusted Platform Module ({TPM)} and group communication.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in in-vehicle technologies have paved way to a new era of connectivity. Vehicle manufacturers have already deployed various technologies for driving assistance, anti-theft, and infotainment. They are now developing ways to interface mobile devices with vehicles and provide the customer's smart phone or tablet the ability to send/receive information to/from the car. However, such an integration introduces severe security risks to the vehicle. The in-vehicle network was originally designed to operate in a closed environment and thus, security was not of concern. It has now become an important issue due to an increasing number of external interfaces to the in-vehicle network. Several studies have already shown that an in-vehicle network can be easily compromised just by connecting cheap commercial devices and doing reverse engineering. Although research efforts have been made to secure in-vehicle networks, most of them focused on defining security requirements, or presenting attack scenarios without providing any feasible solution. Also, to the best of our knowledge, there hasn't been any study with a specific focus on understanding and analyzing the security aspects of integrating mobile devices with cars. In this paper, we define the integration model, present the attack scenarios, define the security objectives, and then propose a 3-step verification mechanism that meets our objectives.},

	abstract = {During the last several years, the interest in wireless networking has grown significantly due to the availability of many wireless products, such as cell phones, wireless enabled mice, keyboards, modems, and many other products. Bluetooth-enabled cell phones, personal digital assistance ({PDAs)}, and laptops are becoming common. Wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) products are growing at a rapid rate. Several companies have already started developing {WiMax} products. The reason for the rapid growth of wireless technology is that it provides the users with additional convenience over the wired technology. General Motors Corporation introduced a Bluetooth network in its 2003 Saab 9-3 model car. Having a wireless personal area network ({WPAN)} in a vehicle will allow the driver to control the various operations within the vehicle without taking his hands off the steering wheel. For example, the driver will be able to make a phone call through a Bluetooth-enabled headset and a Bluetooth-enabled cell phone using voice-activated dialing features. If the Bluetooth network is connected to the vehicle's wired network through an appropriate gateway device, then the driver will be able to control the lights, windshield wipers, air flow, heat, and various other features of the vehicle through a Bluetooth-enabled headset and voice-activated features. An in-vehicle {WPAN} will also allow the users to use their {PDAs} as electronic car keys. Though an in-vehicle {WPAN} can provide the users with many convenient features, it can also make the vehicle system vulnerable to many types of security attacks unless it is properly designed. In this paper, the authors present a technique for building an in-vehicle secure {WPAN} ({SWPAN).} The technique is user friendly and easy to use},

	doi = {10.1109/DASC.2008.4702761},
	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to evaluate alternative networking concepts (standards and protocols), with a particular emphasis on comparing {ARINC} 664 network standard with legacy avionics networks. The conclusions of this comparison are reinforced with an example network solution for the avionics architecture using the Avionics Full- Duplex Switched Ethernet ({AFDX)} protocol. The networking of modules (hardware and software) and applications on an aircraft is crucial, and often new designs and upgrades rely on legacy network architectures. In the past, such systems in defense applications have been successfully integrated around the {1553B} bus architecture, while commercial applications have satisfied {FAA} requirements with systems integrated around the {ARINC} 429 bus architecture. The new applications and capabilities being requested by stakeholders for Avionics systems of the future require increased bandwidth and latency requirements that suggest likely inadequacies in legacy bus architectures. There is continuing pressure by pilots for more information displayed on increasingly more intuitive graphical displays and interfaces; while the ground control and logistics teams want additional and more timely airplane status data - this data is consolidated from a multitude of sub-systems and sensors on board, including event logs and trend data. These new demands may require us to leverage new technologies to keep pace with stakeholder expectations today and in the future. A recent advancement in networking technology is {ARINC} 664, which defines a deterministic version of an Ethernet network. Boeing and Airbus have adopted Avionic Full- Duplex Switched Ethernet for their newer airplanes [1-3], and {NASA} is considering {ARINC} 664 for the new Crew Exploration Vehicle [4]. The B787 is slated to accommodate 100 applications in part due to the availability of larger network bandwidth [5]. {NASA} hopes to benefit from commercial-off-the-shelf ({COTS)} Ethernet components which includ- - e reduced overall costs, faster system development and less-costly maintenance for the system network. Both found {ARINC} 664 to be the best fit in {ARINC} 653 based systems. Integrating an Avionics Full-Duplex Switched Ethernet may benefit the defense industry avionics customer by lowering life cycle cost and accommodating increasing requirements. This paper addresses the speed, reliability, and flexibility of modern network protocols and explores new options for avionics architectures. This applies to either a complete redesign or a phased avionics upgrade in legacy airplanes. For a historical context, this paper also summarizes the value and utility of legacy networking protocols, together with their downsides. Networking standards and protocols are evaluated as a function of critical requirements pertaining to performance, certification, security, reliability, evolvability, cost, and flexibility to meet changing requirements. Methods such as Quality Function Deployment ({QFD)} and Analytic Hierarchy Process ({AHP)} are used to evaluate the three network architectures. The impacts on security and reliability are explored, and additional aspects are highlighted for future research.},

	abstract = {Privacy-preserving Vehicular Peer-to-Peer Network ({VPNET)} is particularly vulnerable to sybil attack, where a malicious vehicle can abuse its multiple unlinkable pseudo-ids to pretend multiple and distinct vehicles in the network. To make the matter even worse, due to the privacy-preserving network environment, zero-day sybil vulnerability is hard to defend against, i.e., a vehicle cannot locally detect a sybil attacker before the attacker is formally revoked. In this paper, aiming at mitigating zero-day sybil vulnerability in privacy-preserving {VPNET}, we propose an efficient Local Sybil Resistance scheme, called {LSR}, to locally detect sybil attack. Especially, in the proposed {LSR} scheme, if a vehicle never signs an event more than once, the signatures it signed cannot be linked, and its privacy can be well protected. However, if a vehicle signs two or more signatures on the same event, any vehicle can easily link these signatures and thus detect a sybil attack locally. Moreover, with two-layer/multi-layer reporting, a sybil attack can be quickly reported to a trusted authority ({TA)} for tracking the sybil attacker's real identity and making global revocation. Detailed security analysis demonstrates that the proposed {LSR} scheme can enhance the security of a privacy-preserving {VPNET}, such as locally detecting sybil attack, preventing a sybil attacker's future attacks before its being revoked by {TA}, et al. In addition, performance evaluation via extensive simulations also confirms the high effectiveness of the proposed {LSR} scheme.},

	abstract = {Vehicular ad hoc network ({VANET)} has extensively used to enhance protection of the passengers and reduce occasion of traffic congestion. Consistent communication in vehicular ad-hoc networks is important to provide functional and reliable traffic safety and efficiency applications. Security is the major issue in the network due to the mobile nature of the vehicle. In this paper we proposed the novel traffic congestion detection and removal scheme against {DDOS} attack Here the attacker behavior is broadcast the huge numbers of false information packets in network i.e. the false information about the traffic. The number of nodes or vehicles that receives the false packet information are affected from attack are called Node. Now if the traffic is jammed or congestion occurring and their information goes to Roadside Unit ({RSU)} then {RSU} must be detected and excluded permanently from the network after applying proposed effective approach. Proposed scheme against {DDOS} attack aims to identify and exclude attackers from the network. In the presence of misbehaving in network the false information is transferred in the network by that the vehicles are deciding to do the routing according to false information. Proposed security scheme recovers control information and improves the performance of {VANET} in the presence of an attacker.},

The result of the decryption will be the hash of the message. 6) Destination vehicle can then hash the message in the same way as source vehicle did and compare the two hashes.

Smart cars, connected vehicles, intelligent transportation systems ({ITS)}, vehicular ad-hoc networks ({VANET)}, and vehicle telematics represent parallel and overlapping technologies and services that will define the future of the American roadway systems. The integration of computing technology and expanding communication services is driving the growing research and development efforts to integrate vehicles and roadway telematic services to improve preventive vehicle safety, reduce traffic congestion, and enable new applications for vehicle maintenance and commercial services. Industrial and governmental efforts are underway to accelerate the introduction of vehicle-to-vehicle ({V2V)} and vehicle-to-infrastructure ({V2I)} communications functions. In the United States these major {ITS} projects have included {US} {DOT} {IntelliDrive}, {CAMP/VSC-2;} {SafeTrip21}, {IEEE} {WAVE}, California {PATH}, and the Connected Vehicle Proving Center ({CVPC).} An Intelligent Transportation System ({ITS)} technical architecture for Service Management has been developed based on {IEEE} 1609 Wireless Access for Vehicular Environments ({WAVE)} standards for secure vehicle-tovehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure wireless communication. This study defines an {ITS} Service Management model based on the networking ({IEEE} 1609.3), and security ({IEEE} 1609.2) protocols. An examination of the working model demonstrates the use of a 1609.3 Provider Service Identifier ({PSID)} to provision and secure {ITS} services and applications using the D {SRC/WAVE} communication stack.},

	title = {Vehicle {ECU} classification based on safety-security characteristics},
	abstract = {An upcoming trend for automotive manufacturers is to perform remote diagnostics and firmware updates over the air, which allows identifying hardware problems and correction of software flaws with minimal customer inconvenience. These procedures require that the previously isolated in-vehicle network permits external communication, which introduces a number of security risks, e.g., cyber attack threats. In this paper, we identify cyber attack threats and classify the electronic control units ({ECUs)} in the in-vehicle network to assist in determining which ones to protect and restrict access to. We divide the {ECUs} into five categories: powertrain, vehicle safety, comfort, infotainment, and telematics. We then use four safety integrity levels to classify the {ECU} categories. Moreover, we define safety effect levels of security threats which are used to classify identified attacks in the remote diagnostics and firmware updates over the air procedures. The safety and security levels are combined to classify the {ECU} categories. From the results we conclude that {ECU} categories such as powertrain and vehicle safety require further protection prior to introducing remote connectivity. As a conclusion, we suggest that automotive manufacturers should emphasize security or restrict the remote diagnostics and firmware updates over the air procedures to certain {ECUs.}},

	abstract = {Vehicular Ad Hoc Network ({VANET)} is a challenging area of research in the field of vehicular technology. It is an emerging topic for its high mobility and high link disruption. But if link disruption is due to the malicious drivers in the network then it reduces the performance of the network. Hole Generation attack is a kind of attack in which the malicious drivers breaks the communication links between the vehicles by increasing or decreasing their own speeds when they are a part of the network. In this paper, we proposed a Robust Routing Protocol ({RRP)} to send the message securely from source to destination by surviving from the hole generation attack. {RRP} consists of a security module to recognize a genuine node and a recovery module to resist the hole created by the malicious drivers. {RRP} network model is mainly divided into three phases: first phase is the hole detection phase in which the hole is detected, in the second phase hole information is broadcasted in the whole network and in the third phase the data is transmitted from source to destination by selecting a secure optimal path. Simulation result shows {RRP} performs better than {GPSR} when security and recovery is considered. It has a high packet delivery ratio when malicious drivers are considered in the network.},

This paper offers an architecture that will utilize a hybrid smart grid technology, wireless and powerline communication ({PLC)} as a medium. This paper suggests that using microprocessor technology to generate short message bursts utilising hybrid transmission mediums will allow for efficient and accurate transmission with low Bit Error Rates ({BER).} Remote immobilizer functionality is the ultimate aim of this research.

This security needs to be considered over the course of the product lifecycle and includes a consideration of requirements definitions, design, development, testing, and maintenance. Even though many technologies and guidelines have been proposed to address end-to-end security design problems for the {IT} (information technology) industry, there are often significant differences between securing {IT} equipment (such as servers and {PCs)} and securing vehicles. Thus, purely {IT-based} approaches often have limited applicability in the domain of vehicle security because human safety is a primary design consideration in the development of vehicles, while relatively less attention has been paid to {IT} security. In addition, the lifecycle of a vehicle is often much longer than the lifecycle of many {PCs} and related {IT} equipment. Security design tends to be performed in “silos” and is not well coordinated among all of the stakeholders who are involved in the development of a vehicle. We have devised a specialized approach for designing secure in-vehicle infotainment systems, including the electronic control system and software. Our approach is based on secure engineering, an established methodology used in the {IT} industry to cover the entire software lifecycle.},

	abstract = {Summary form only given. Electronics have become the main subject and a fundamental innovation engine in the automotive industry. According to ongoing studies the share of electronics in vehicles will increase by 5 percent annually on the average. By the use of modern electronics and software it is today possible to improve classical functions such as power windows and to give the customers a variety of new safety and security features that would not be imaginable without electronics, e.g. the {ESP} system. The development of such electronic systems is demanding for all parties involved. Processes must be harmonized with each other and robust systems must be realized. In addition to consumer acceptance the quality and reliability are the keys to success. The first part this presentation highlights some innovations and trends in vehicle electronics. Especially in the driver assistance and information systems new applications are possible through the intelligent combination of existing sensors and actuators. These new applications allow improved safety and security in vehicles. But those new applications also make an issue out of the reliability which is being controversially discussed. The second part of this presentation will focus on these arguments and discuss some methods to cope with the new reliability requirements associated with more complex electronic systems. The higher demand for safety and security on the one hand and the reliability requirements on the other points out the areas of conflict in which both the automobile manufacturer and the customer are caught in between. In the last part of the presentation those contradictions was discussed, and a path was pointed out how to resolve the matter of dispute: is it possible to have improved safety and security through vehicle electronics?},

In certain areas, such as government buildings, army camps or country borders, the vehicles are inspected before allowed to enter. As this inspection needs to be thorough, it is a rather time-consuming process. To address this issue, this paper proposes a combination of distinct computer vision inspection systems that have been developed in the Multimedia Technology Laboratory of the National Technical University of Athens, to automatically identify a vehicle entering a restricted area. The proposed system includes automatic license plate recognition, vehicle manufacturer/model detection and under-vehicle inspection. Combining the aforementioned methods can help to minimize the limitations of each individual technique and increase security in vehicle inspection. The characteristics, extracted during inspection, can be compared to the actual characteristics of each vehicle, which are acquired off-line and then stored in a vehicle record database.},

We first analyze the unique features of urban {VANET} that vehicles have different types, and move as clusters due to the influence of traffic lights. Then a two tier architecture called Mobile Infrastructure Based {VANET} ({MIVANET)} is proposed. In this architecture, the buses constitute a mobile backbone for data delivery while the low tier is composed of ordinary cars and passengers. {MI-VANET} will not only bring the benefit that ordinary cars do not have to forward packets for other nodes, but also improve the network connectivity. The corresponding Mobile Infrastructure Registering ({MIRG)} and Mobile Infrastructure Routing ({MIRT)} algorithms are also presented. The bus line information is made full use in {MIRT.} Simulation results show that there is a 40-55\% improvement in delivery ratio while the throughput is even doubled compared to {GPSR} in traditional {VANET.}},

	abstract = {Vehicular Ad-hoc Network ({VANET)} enables wireless communications among vehicles. {VANET} applications benefit to the society with improved transportation safety and efficiency. However, security issues in delivering contents over infrastructureless wireless communication hinder {VANET} applications. Though security schemes have been proposed, the public remains skeptical due to the lack of common metrics to measure their effectiveness. This paper proposes an asymmetric profit-loss Markov ({APLM)} model to measure the integrity level of security schemes for {VANET} content delivery. Profit defines integrity gain to a system by its devices detecting and disregarding corrupted data fragments. Loss represents negative effect to a system at receiving a corrupted data fragment. Markov chain records change of system behavior that reacts to profit and loss asymmetrically. The advantage of {APLM} model is its black-box approach that measures the integrity level without the need to examine the implementation details of a particular security scheme, rendering the model feasible for real world applications. Taking into account the special characteristics of integrity schemes in {VANET}, {APLM} model is tested on five scenarios. The measuring results demonstrate meaningfulness, repeatability, and feasibility of {APLM} model. {APLM} model also supports optimization of security scheme design for {VANET} content delivery.},

The method of {VD-GREEDY} expands forward zone to ensure the existence of next-hop nodes and limits the numbers of next Chop nodes to lower overhead. At the same time, to lower overload, we use the way of opportunistic routing in the target region where we choose the best node to go on transmitting for next target region.

	abstract = {Vehicle to Vehicle ({V2V)} and Vehicle to Infrastructure ({V2I)} communication are playing an important role in improving the road safety and comfort. Communication between cars often referred to vehicular ad-hoc networks ({VANET)} has many advantages such as reducing cars accidents, minimizing the traffic jam, reducing fuel consumption and emissions, etc. {VANET} architecture has been standardized in the {IEEE} 802.11p specification. {VANETs} beaconing is one of the most important communication modes, which is used to broadcast the information of a car to the neighbour cars. This paper deals with simulation of car to car communication in realistic large-scale urban area (real traffic and map) based on {IEEE} 802.11p standard and investigates the successful beacon delivery probability. This study calculates the Probability of Beacon Delivery ({PBD)} in realistic simulation and compares that with the mathematical model. {PBD} for cars in different situations are calculated (for example {PBD} for one particular car in the city, one group of cars in the street, cars in the crossroad, {PBD} in a large area with different traffic density, etc.). Studying the {PBD} of 802.11p is necessary to find out whether this technology is effective before implementing in the real world. This study is the first study performed on the {PBD} of 802.11p in realistic large urban area. The results show that the {PBD} of 802.11p in a large area with huge density of cars is quite low. In addition, in this study different {VANET} simulators are investigated. As a result {SUMO} for traffic simulation, {OMNeT++} for Network Simulation and Veins framework for integration of {OMNeT++} and {SUMO} are selected in this study.},

	abstract = {Vehicular Ad-hoc Network ({VANET)} can be envisaged as the network of moving vehicles communicating in asynchronous and autonomous fashion. Efficient and scalable information dissemination is a major challenge due to the movement of vehicles which causes unpredictable changes in network topology. {Publish/Subscribe} communication paradigm provides decoupling in time, space and synchronization between communicating entities, making it most suitable for {VANET} like environments. In this paper, we propose our publish/subscribe framework for information dissemination in {VANET.} In our approach, we assumed a hybrid {VANET} consisting of stationary info-stations and moving vehicles where each vehicle can take the role of publisher, subscriber or broker. Every major crossing of city is equipped with stationary info-stations that act as ultimate place holders for publications and subscriptions. These info-stations are assumed to be connected to internet and form Distributed Hash Table ({DHT)} based broker overlay among themselves. They act as rendezvous point for publications and subscriptions and send matching publications to interested subscribers. Further, these info-stations also provide services for locating any vehicle in the network. Simulation results indicate that our approach performs well with increasing number of vehicles which suggests the applicability of our approach.},

One primary issue among researches is to verify the reliability of {FlexRay} systems either from protocol aspect or from system design aspect. However, for more precisely addressing the {FlexRay} system reliability issue, we require a more generic analysis that simultaneously considers the network topology, clock sync between {FlexRay} {ECUs} and the {ECU} fault-tolerance. To fulfill this requirement, in this paper we first apply a well-known reliability model, Dynamic Fault Tree ({DFT)}, to model the reliability of {FlexRay} systems with various network topologies, and then employ the Markov Chain ({MC)} to model the reliability of clock sync in terms of the number of sync {ECUs.} Furthermore, various fault-tolerant techniques for {ECUs} protection are also modeled by {MC.} The adopted two reliability models, {DFT} and {MC}, are integrated to form a mixed {DFT} to assess the {FlexRay} system reliability more accurately. Through a {FlexRay} steer-by-wire case study, we demonstrate the influence of different topologies, different {ECU} fault-tolerance and various number of sync {ECUs} on the reliability of {FlexRay} steer-by-wire system.},

A critical security threat to {VANETs} is false data injection, i.e., an attacker disseminates false information to disrupt the behavior of the other drivers. Information driven operations of vehicular networks make false data injection a very effective attack. As the first line of defense, this paper presents the notion of proof-of-relevance ({PoR)}, which consists in proving that the event reporter is authentically relevant to the event it has reported. The {PoR} is accomplished by collecting authentic consensus on the event from witness vehicles in a cooperative way. Event reports from attackers who fail to provide this {PoR} are disregarded, making the network immune to bogus data.

	doi = {10.1109/ICMECH.2006.252561},
	abstract = {Communication layers underlying modern distributed systems have different advantages and disadvantages that are consequences of the different properties of the communication layer. One such property is "hot-plug" capability (the ability to dynamically and automatically reconfigure the system) of the communication layer and another one is security (in this context, authentication and encryption). The problem is that there is a hidden contradiction between the hot-plug capability and security, which leads us to the need of secure, hot-plug capable communication layers. This is crucial in wireless communication layers where security and hot-plug capabilities may be mandatory for the distributed system to succeed, even if the system is not as life-critical as an in-car wireless sensor network. In life-critical systems, such as systems analyzed by the authors, this contradiction is significant enough to risk the existence of the system. This article presents the underlying contradiction of logics for secure hot-plug and analyzes some of the currently available solutions to reduce risks while pointing out similarities and differences between the theoretical secure hot-plug wireless systems and the practically semi-secure semi-hot-plug Internet. The problems of the traditional approaches in life-critical wireless sensor systems such as medical sensor networks and in-vehicle wireless networks are presented and risk-reducing methods are shown},

Moreover, technologies that will help to advance safety and energy efficiency of {EVs} such as drive-by-wire and information systems are discussed. Regarding the system architecture, we present challenges in the domain of communication and computation platforms. A paradigm shift towards time-triggered in-vehicle communication systems becomes inevitable for the sake of determinism, making the introduction of new bus systems and protocols necessary. At the same time, novel computational devices promise high processing power at low cost which will make a reduction in the number of Electronic Control Units ({ECUs)} possible. As a result, the software design has to be performed in a holistic manner, considering the controlled component while transparently abstracting the underlying hardware architecture. For this purpose, we show how middleware and verification techniques can help to reduce the design and test complexity. At the same time, with the growing connectivity of {EVs}, security has to become a major design objective, considering possible threats and a security-aware design as discussed in this paper.},

	abstract = {Over the past decade, the design process in the automotive industry has gone through a period of significant changes. Modern vehicles present a complex interaction of a large number of embedded Electronic Control Units ({ECUs)}, interacting with each other over different types of networks. Furthermore, there is a current shift in vehicle architectures, from isolated control systems to more open automotive architectures with new services such as vehicle-tovehicle communication, and remote diagnostics and code updates. However, this increasing set of functionalities, network interoperability, and complexity of the system design may introduce security vulnerabilities that are easily exploitable. Typically, modern vehicular control systems are not built with security in mind. As shown in [1], attackers can easily disrupt the operation of a car to either disable the vehicle or hijack it, giving the attacker a large control capability over the system. This problem is even more emphasized with the rise of vehicle autonomy; hence, criticality analysis for automotive components must be completely re-done. To address these issues, we have introduced a design framework for development of high-confidence vehicular control systems that can be used in adversarial environments. The framework employs control system design techniques (control-level defenses) that guarantee that the vehicle will maintain control, possibly at a reduced efficiency, under a variety of externally-originating attacks on sensors, actuators, and communication and computation resources. In the system development phase, we provide code-level defenses that prevent injection of malicious code into the operation of the controller itself. Using a formal representation of execution and code generation semantics, we remove the uncertainty from the code generation process and provide secure code synthesis for the derived controllers.},

Accordingly, the secure architecture of the network gateway that can avoid or isolate the malicious behavior of external nodes is very critical for the next-generation vehicles. In this paper, we design a safe vehicular network gateway by exploiting full virtualization technology. Since the virtualization adds additional overheads, we try to minimize this side effect while considering the security by carefully choosing the communication mechanisms in the virtualized gateway. In our preliminary implementation, we use Virtual Box to run Linux and {QNX} as guest operating systems, which handles external (Wi-Fi) and internal ({CAN)} networks, respectively. The performance measurement results show that the virtualization-based gateway adds only 10\% overhead compared with non-virtualized gateway while improving the security. We also show that the multi-core processor can leverage performance improvement.},

We use the term "last inch" to characterize the challenges of delivering computing services through in-vehicle human-machine interfaces ({HMIs)} to users who are sometimes driving at speeds upwards of 70 miles per hour. We focus on the nonfunctional requirements of security, privacy, usability, and reliability ({SPUR)).} These attributes both encompass safety concerns and offer insight into the consumer experience. We took the {SPUR} requirements into account in designing our vehicle consumer services interface ({VCSI)}, a service-oriented middleware architecture that we've implemented in a demonstration vehicle},

	abstract = {Cyber-security is a rising issue for automotive electronic systems, and it is critical to system safety and dependability. Current in-vehicles architectures, such as those based on the Controller Area Network ({CAN)}, do not provide direct support for secure communications. When retrofitting these architectures with security mechanisms, a major challenge is to ensure that system safety will not be hindered, given the limited computation and communication resources. We apply Message Authentication Codes ({MACs)} to protect against masquerade and replay attacks on {CAN} networks, and propose an optimal Mixed Integer Linear Programming ({MILP)} formulation for solving the mapping problem from a functional model to the {CAN-based} platform while meeting both the security and the safety requirements. We also develop an efficient heuristic for the mapping problem under security and safety constraints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to address security and safety in an integrated formulation in the design automation of automotive electronic systems. Experimental results of an industrial case study show the effectiveness of our approach.},

	doi = {10.1109/SIES.2012.6356590},
	abstract = {Controller Area Network ({CAN)} is the most widely used protocol in the automotive domain. Bus-based {CAN} does not provide any security mechanisms to counter manipulations like eavesdropping, fabrication of messages, or denial-of-service attacks. The vulnerabilities in bus-based {CAN} are alarming, because safety-critical subsystems (e.g., the power train) often deploy a {CAN} bus, and hence a failure propagation from the security domain to the safety domain can take place. In this paper we propose a star coupling router and a trust model for this router to overcome some of the security deficiencies present in bus-based {CAN} systems. The {CAN} router establishes a partitioning of a {CAN} bus into separate {CAN} segments and allows to rigorously check the traffic within the {CAN} system, including the value and time domains. We evaluate the introduced trust model on a prototype implementation of the {CAN} router by performing attacks that would be successful on classic bus-based {CAN}, but are detected and contained on router-based {CAN.} The router can consequently increase the security in automotive applications and render some of the attacks described in the literature (e.g., fuzzying attack) on a car useless. Since the {CAN} router offers ports that are compatible to standard {CAN}, the router can be used to increase the security of legacy {CAN} based systems.},

It also includes a scheme for symmetric key exchange and automatic key update at specific time intervals. In addition, the protocol includes a new idea called Key Refresh. The Key Refresh is a simple scheme that can be an alternative to operating the cipher in processor intensive chaining or feedback modes. The industrial field devices are equipped with the {TMS} series of digital signal processors to perform {DES} encryption/decryption. Since these processors are already present embedded in many of the state-of-art field devices, they were chosen so that the protocol would not require additional hardware. The protocol is generic and can run over any of the commercial Fieldbus networks},

	doi = {10.1109/GLOCOMW.2008.ECP.56},
	abstract = {An upcoming trend for automobile manufacturers is to provide firmware updates over the air ({FOTA)} as a service. Since the firmware controls the functionality of a vehicle, security is important. To this end, several secure {FOTA} protocols have been developed. However, the secure {FOTA} protocols only solve the security for the transmission of the firmware binary. Once the firmware is downloaded, an attacker could potentially modify its contents before it is flashed to the corresponding {ECU'S} {ROM.} Thus, there is a need to extend the flashing procedure to also verify that the correct firmware has been flashed to the {ECU.} We present a framework for self-verification of firmware updates over the air. We include a verification code in the transmission to the vehicle, and after the firmware has been flashed, the integrity of the memory contents can be verified using the verification code. The verification procedure entails only simple hash functions and is thus suitable for the limited resources in the vehicle. Virtualization techniques are employed to establish a trusted computing base in the {ECU}, which is then used to perform the verification. The proposed framework allows the {ECU} itself to perform self-verification and can thus ensure the successful flashing of the firmware.},
